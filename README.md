This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## project requirement

Project Requirement: Temperature Data UI Component
Context: A parameter T1 (temperature reading, range: -5 to +5) is collected every second for a plant.

You have to build a UI component using Apache ECharts to display this data.

Data Source
Historical Data: Fetched via API (up to 3 days of data).

Live Data: Received over WebSocket, sending:

All data from the past 3 days upon connection.

A new data point every second thereafter.

UI Features
Default view: Hourly summary (e.g., one point per hour).

Zoom support: Drill down from:

Day → Hour → Minute → Second.

Visualization should adapt based on zoom level.

Displayed using ECharts (line chart, with smooth transitions).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
